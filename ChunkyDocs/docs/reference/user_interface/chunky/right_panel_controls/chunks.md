- <samp>Export chunks to ZIP</samp>: Opens a 'Save As' dialog box to export the selected chunks as region files containing the chunks to a ZIP archive.

- <samp>Export view to PNG</samp>: Opens a 'Save As' dialog box to export the current map view as a PNG file.

- <samp>Delete selected chunks</samp>: Displays a confirmation prompt for the user to delete the selected chunks from the currently-loaded world. (Chunks can be re-generated by Minecraft, but all user-created data in the chunks will be lost. It is a good idea to keep a backup of your world before performing this action.)
